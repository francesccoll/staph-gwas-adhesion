# Genetic Determinants of *Staphylococcus aureus* Adhesion Shape Virulence Trade-offs in Bacteremia

This GitHub project contains the code necessary to reproduce the GWAS analyses in the study 'Genetic Determinants of *Staphylococcus aureus* Adhesion Shape Virulence Trade-offs in Bacteremia', and includes the following directories:
  * assembly: scripts for de novo assembly and genome annotation.
  * kmers: scripts to create kmers from genome assemblies.
  * mapping: scripts for short-read mapping and variant calling.
  * phylogeny: script to generate core-genome phylogenies.
  * pyseer: scripts to run PySeer GWAS analayses from kmers, to annotate kmers, to summarise associated kmers within loci, and to group them in kmer groups.
